Dx11Sandbox
===========
Dx11Sandbox is my home project to try different kinds of rendering and engineering techniques on DirectX 11. 
*The project uses now depricated DXUT library.

Dx11Sandbox has a Tile-based deferred renderer and uses physically based materials. There is no spatial partitioning or occlusion culling for the objects, but the frustrum culling is done efficiently via cache friendly memory pooler and SIMD.
